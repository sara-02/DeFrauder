# Spotting Collective Behaviour of Online Frauds in Customer Reviews

This is the code for the paper titled

**Spotting Collective Behaviour of Online Frauds in Customer Reviews. Sarthika Dhawan\*,Siva Charan Reddy Gangireddy, Shiv Kumar, Tanmoy Chakraborty**

accepted at [28th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence](https://ijcai19.org/).

# Quick Start

## Requirements

* Python
To install the dependencies used in the code, you can use the __requirements.txt__ file as follows -

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the code

Run the ```detection.py``` followed by ```refine_groups.py``` as follows -

```
python2 detection.py
```

The agruments it takes are (All are mandatory):
   - ```--metadata```: Path to metadata for the particular dataset.
   - ```--rc```: Path to review content for the particular dataset.
   - ```--dg```: Path to save the groups detected (json format).
```
python2 refine_groups.py
```  

The agruments it takes are (All are mandatory):
   - ```--metadata```: Path to metadata for the particular dataset.
   - ```--rc```: Path to review content for the particular dataset.
   - ```--groups```: Path to groups generated by ```detection.py```.
   - ```--outputgroups```: Path to save the output groups (json format).

This will generate fraud reviewer groups for the particular dataset.


Run the ```emb.py``` and ```ranking.py``` as follows -

```
python2 ```emb.py``` as follows -
```

The agruments it takes are (All are mandatory):
   - ```--metadata```: Path to metadata for the particular dataset.
   - ```--rc```: Path to review content for the particular dataset.
   - ```--um```: Path to userIdMapping.
   - ```--pm```: Path to productIdMapping.
   - ```--edge```: Path to USERS_edgelistOWN.txt
   - ```--adj```: Path to USERS_adjlistOWN.txt

Convert the weighted edge list into Node2vec consumeable format.

```
cp USERS_edgelistOWN.txt USERS_edgelistOWN.edgelist
```

Move to the node2vec repo and run the following command
```
python2 src/main.py
```
The arguments it takes are (All are mandatory):
   - ```--input```: Path to USERS_edgelistOWN.edgelist(format .edgelist)
   - ```--output```: Path to node2vec.emd (format .emd)
   - ```----weighted``` : Since the edges have weights between 2 reviewers.


```
python2 ranking.py
```
The agruments it takes are (All are mandatory):
   - ```--groups```: Path to groups generated by ```refine_groups.py```.
   - ```--ef```: Path to reviewer embeddings (.emd generated before)
   - ```--rankedgroups```: Ranked group IDs (txt format, line separated IDs).
    
This will rank fraud reviewer groups for the particular dataset.<br>
Provide appropriate paths for data files and parameters.
